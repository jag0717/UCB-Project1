UCB Project I Proposal

Project Title - Assessing homelessness versus real estate prices in Silicon Valley since the 2008 recession (10 years of data).

Team Members – Lei, Jagatha, Angela and Weiming

Project Description/Outline - For this project we will be compiling real estate data from Zillow and correlate it to the homelessness data compiled from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD Exchange Site) for the past decade, focusing primarily on the Silicon Valley region.

Research Questions to Answer -
1. Is homelessness associated with real estate prices? 
2. At what rate has homelessness changed since 2008? 
3. At what rate have real estate prices changed since the 2008 recession?
4. What is the demographics of the homeless population - gender, age, race.
5. What were the prior living arrangements and what are the current living arrangements of the homeless population.

Data Sets to be Used - 
Zillow API- https://www.zillow.com/howto/api/APIOverview.htm

Homeless Data  from HUD -https://www.hudexchange.info/resource/3031/pit-and-hic-data-since-2007/
-https://learn.arcgis.com/en/projects/homeless-in-the-badlands/lessons/download-homelessness-data.htm

Rough Breakdown of Tasks - TBD
1. Figure out how to extract data from Zillow API- specifically housing prices based on city and/zipcode.
2. Delimit our region of interest - All of Silicon Valley? A specific county? Specific city? Or Zipcode?
3. Continue to explore the homelessness database and figure out how to associate it to the real estate data. How is the homelessness database broken down - by state, by county, by city, by zipcode?

1. Some thoughts: the US economy has only continued to improve since 2008. This is likely to still reveal some interesting insights, but isolating your analysis to this period may reveal trends that aren't representative of history. You'd face the same problem if you only looked at stock market data since 2008. If you can find data since the 1990's on both homelessness and housing prices, you'd have at least two major boom and bust periods for the economy. Tracking homelessness and housing price rates across that period would give you data to make more general conclusions about the impact of these two variables on one another, and the impact of the general economic growth on both of these variables.

2.You should think about the presence of other, confounding variables. i.e. is there a third variable that affects both housing prices and homelessness that you're missing?

3.Even if you make Silicon Valley the focus of your analysis, it might be good to review data from other parts of the country to see if your conclusions stand elsewhere.

4. [Related to question #5] Can you make this question slightly more concrete?

5.[Related to task #3] I would prioritize answering this question. If you can't get HUD data by zip, but you're fetching Zillow data by zip, you could have a problem joining the two data sets
